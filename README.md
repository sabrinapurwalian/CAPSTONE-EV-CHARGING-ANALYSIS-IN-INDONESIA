# CAPSTONE EV CHARGING ANALYSIS IN INDONESIA
# EV Charging Infrastructure in Indonesia: Strategic Analysis for Investment and Policy Acceleration

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the readiness and distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Indonesia using publicly available global data. The goal is to identify infrastructure gaps, classify regional readiness, and generate business-oriented recommendations for private sector investment and public policy.

## Raw Dataset
- [charging_stations_2025_world.csv](./charging_stations_2025_world.csv): Global dataset of EV charging stations in 2025
- [charging_station_indonesia_2025.csv](./charging_station_indonesia_2025.csv): Filtered and classified subset focused on Indonesia

## Insight & Findings

### 1. Key Infrastructure Challenges Across Provinces

The data reveals several challenges in EV charging infrastructure across various provinces in Indonesia by 2025:

- **Limited Number of Ports**: Most entries indicate only one or, at most, two ports per location, highlighting a scarcity of charging facilities. This is particularly evident in major cities like Bali (Ubud, Mengwi, Kabupaten Tabanan), Yogyakarta, and Surabaya.
- **Insufficient Power Output**: Many provinces, especially in Bali and West Java, have chargers with lower power outputs ranging from 22kW to 149kW. This may not suffice for rapid charging needs of modern EVs, slowing down travel times.
- **Type Dominance**: Direct Current (DC) Fast Chargers predominate the data, though AC High Power chargers are also present in locations such as Jakarta Selatan and multiple unidentified entries. This might suggest an initial focus on DC fast charging but potentially overlooking other types suitable for different EV models or slower charging needs.
- **Readiness Status**: Almost all listed sites fall under the "Lagging" readiness category, indicating a widespread gap between the current infrastructure and the demand or expected future demand for EV charging in these regions.

### 2. Patterns in Readiness Classification

The readiness classification consistently labels most entries as "Lagging," pointing to systemic underdevelopment of EV charging infrastructure across surveyed cities in Indonesia. This pattern suggests:

- **Uneven Development**: While some provinces like Jawa Barat and East Java show multiple sites, their readiness status remains low, indicating uneven distribution and quality of infrastructure.
- **Slow Response to Market Demand**: The consistent lagging classification implies a failure or delay in responding to the growing demand for EV charging, potentially due to insufficient planning, investment, or regulatory frameworks.

## Recommendations

### For Private Sector Investment

1. **Strategic Expansion**: Target high-traffic areas and major urban centers like Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bali for increased charging station deployment. Focus on both DC Fast Chargers to cater to rapid charging needs and AC High Power units for slower, more common charging scenarios.
2. **Collaboration with Real Estate and Hospitality**: Partner with hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and residential complexes to install chargers as part of value-added services, ensuring wider accessibility.
3. **Technological Innovation**: Invest in smart charging solutions, such as dynamic load management systems, to optimize grid utilization and efficiency.
4. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Implement data analytics to understand usage patterns and tailor infrastructure deployment accordingly, enhancing ROI.

### For Public Policy

1. **Incentives for Infrastructure Development**: Offer tax breaks, subsidies, or grants to private investors committing to setting up EV charging stations in underserved areas, especially rural provinces and smaller cities.
2. **Standardized Regulations**: Enforce consistent standards for EV chargers across the country to ensure compatibility with diverse EV models and promote user convenience.
3. **Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)**: Facilitate PPP models to build out critical infrastructure, leveraging private sector efficiencies while ensuring public accessibility.
4. **Promote Awareness Campaigns**: Run campaigns highlighting the benefits of EVs and availability of charging infrastructure to drive consumer demand and alleviate range anxiety.
5. **Research and Development Support**: Foster R&D initiatives in local universities and tech hubs to develop tailored EV solutions for Indonesia's unique needs, including climate conditions and energy grid characteristics.

By addressing these infrastructural challenges, promoting strategic investment, and aligning public policy with market dynamics, Indonesia can significantly advance its transition towards a sustainable electric mobility future.

## AI Support Explanation
AI was used via **LM Studio** with the **IBM Granite-3.3-8B-Instruct** model to:
- Classify infrastructure readiness based on port count, power output, and charger type
- Summarize key infrastructure challenges across provinces
- Generate business-oriented recommendations for investment and policy

Prompting followed a structured Clarity–Context–Format framework to ensure relevance and actionable output. All analysis and classification were performed in Google Colab using Python.
